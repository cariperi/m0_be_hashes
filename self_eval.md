# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?\
*At first, I struggled with printing the value of the "nth" key in a hash. I didn't realize you could use the access syntax `[0]` with the `.values` built-in method. I also accidentally kept typing `(0)` instead of brackets and had to read back into the lesson to figure it out.*
- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?\
*In truth, I've been taking fairly minimal notes so far, partially because I'm somewhat familiar with most of the syntax and concepts from some earlier study of Ruby. However, I've been doing lots of typing in irb to see how things work, and taking some basic notes on the terminology we're learning as I practice talking about technical concepts. The key terms highlighted at the beginning of each lesson are useful, and I usually try to write definitions of each and test myself for each one as I go through the lesson.*
- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?\
*Solving in code, generally! Especially if I've tried and haven't succeeded - I play around a bit in IRB if I can. If I'm approaching something and haven't written anything yet, I often Google first to see if there's an example I can use or a quick reference, e.g. for a new method to try.*
